Deploying JAR/WAR/EAR projects to Heroku

  {{{https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java}Create
  new application}} in Heroku.

  Download Heroku SSH key (<<<heroku.pem>>>) and put it
  somewhere outside of project directory (in your CI server). Configure
  the server (and its private key) in
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers}<<<settings.xml>>>}}

+--
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>heroku.com</id>
      <privateKey>${user.home}/.ssh/id_rsa</privateKey>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
+--

  Configure <<<jcabi-heroku-maven-plugin>>> in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
        <artifactId>jcabi-heroku-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${releasedVersion}</version>
        <configuration>
          <server>heroku.com</server> <!-- name from settings.xml -->
          <name>my-test-app</name>
          <artifacts>
            <artifact>com.example:example-app:jar::\${project.version}</artifact>
          </artifacts>
          <procfile>web: java -Xmx256m -jar ./example-app.jar \${PORT}</procfile>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>deploy</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+--

  Every artifact will be downloaded during deployment into the root
  directory of the application (in Heroku server).
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates}Maven coordinates}}
  are used to specify artifact locations (always five parts).
  Downloaded artifacts are renamed to <<<artifactId.packaging>>> format.

  Run <<<mvn deploy>>>.

  If you have any problems - don't hesitate to submit a ticket
  to {{{https://github.com/yegor256/jcabi}github}}.
